/*
 Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair
 of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order. This algorithm is not suitable
 for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n2) where n is the number of items.
